[NOTE]
This repo is a part of: https://bitbucket.org/fdesmedt/openframework/overview

I made some modifications to it for my own use.
And I used it a long time ago, *code for training the model is lost*...

[Usage]
# detect person in image and crop them
./ped_det_acf_crop path/to/image/dir output/path
